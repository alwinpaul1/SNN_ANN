# Gen1 Dataset Configuration
# Based on paper: Ahmed et al. (arXiv:2403.10173v4)

data:
  root_dir: './data/gen1'  # UPDATE THIS to your Gen1 dataset path
  height: 304
  width: 240
  num_time_bins: 10          # T=10 bins
  bin_duration_ms: 5.0       # 5ms per bin (50ms total)

model:
  num_classes: 2             # CORRECTED: Gen1 has 2 classes (car, pedestrian)
  in_channels: 2             # Polarity channels
  tau_init: 2.0              # Initial PLIF time constant
  asab_kernel_size: 5        # TSDC kernel size (paper: "kernel size for Φ_tsdc is set to 5")

training:
  epochs: 50                 # Paper: "trained end-to-end for 50 epochs on Gen 1"
  batch_size: 24             # Paper: "batch size of 24"
  learning_rate: 2.0e-4      # Paper: "learning rate of 2×10^-4"
  weight_decay: 1.0e-4
  num_workers: 8
  checkpoint_dir: './checkpoints'
  
  # OneCycle scheduler (paper: "OneCycle learning rate schedule")
  scheduler:
    pct_start: 0.3           # Warmup percentage
    div_factor: 25           # Initial lr = max_lr / div_factor
    final_div_factor: 10000  # Final lr = max_lr / final_div_factor

# Expected results (from paper Table 1-2):
# - mAP(.5:.05:.95): 0.35
# - mAP(.5): 0.61
# - Parameters: 6.6M
# - Training time: ~8 hours on 4x 3090 (~3-4 hours on A100)
